<p>Hello for your visiting this instruction page. This is <em>Andy-K-Sparklight</em> speaking.</p>
<p>You may feel strange about my avatar, that’s because…</p>

<p>Nope, not at all.</p>

<p><strong>Elements of Harmony</strong>, just like it’s name, is a <strong>Minecraft MOD</strong>, and, obviously, is inspired of <em>My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</em>.</p>
<p>This MOD, which is build with <strong>Forge API</strong>, inserts six <em>Elements of Harmony</em> into Minecraft. These elements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Loyalty</li>
<li>Laughter</li>
<li>Generosity</li>
<li>Honesty</li>
<li>Kindness</li>
<li>Magic</li>
</ul>
<p>(They are arranged in the order in <em>My Little Pony Theme Song</em>)</p>
<p>All we want to do is to make Minecraft as close as possible to Equestria, and Elements of Harmony is an essential part. It includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Six Elements</strong>, including their various forms.</li>
<li><strong>Advancements</strong> of your life in Minecraft. (Not Featured)</li>
<li><strong>A (or more) Dimension(s)</strong> for Equestria. (Not Featured)</li>
<li><strong>Basic Support</strong> for further development. (Not Featured)</li>
</ul>
